## Stastics
1. **Descriptive** - organizing & presenting data
2. **Inferential** - make prediction based on sample trends

<hr/>

**Population** - A large set of individuals <br/>
**Parametere** - A characteristic of population(avg)<br/> 
**Sample** - A set of individuals selected from sample<br/>
**Stastic** - A measurable characteristic of sample(x-bar)<br/> 

<hr/>

## Types Of Data
1. Nominal - use no. as names (These are just identifiers/categories)
2. Ordinal Data - no. means something (high/low)
3. Interval - diff b/w no. starts to mean something (thermometere temp)
4. Ratio 

<hr/>

## Probability
- Probability
- Conditional Probability
P(A|B) = P(Aâˆ©B) / P(B)

<hr/>

## Statistics
1. Mean (avergae)
2. Median (middle data)
3. Mode (highest frequency)
4. Variance (how much variability you have in a group of numbers)
* =var.p() -> /n   (population)
* =var.s() -> /n-1   (sample)
5. V= (standard-deviation)<sup>2</sup>
6. z-score / standard-score
- (x-mean)/standard-deviation
- 0 (avg)
- +ve (above avg)
- -ve (below avg)
7. Normal Distribution

## Sampling Disribution
- random, bias,....
- Central Limit Theorem (if N>30 use s/root(N))
- t-distibution

## confidence in estimation
- alpha
- intervals
- critical value (norm.s.inv(alpna/2)) (standard-normal-distribution)
- t-distribution (t.inv(alpha/2,N-1))

<hr/>

## Hypothesis Testing
- Type I Error
- Type II Error


<hr/>

## ANOVA (Analysis of variance)

## Regression
- predict data for another variable (dependent var)
- = slope(x,y) - m
- = intercept() - c
- y=mx+c
- residual variance (steyx(x,y))<sup>2</sup>)

## Correlation
- +ve (inc slope) - ex. height and weight
- -ve (dec slope) - ex. grade and attendance
- 0 (flat line) (variable not co-related)
